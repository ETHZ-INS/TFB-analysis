# TFBlearner Analysis

This repository contains scripts used for generating TF-Binding predictions, figures etc. using the [TFBlearner package](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/TFBlearner).

The benchmarking scripts are saved in a separate repository: [Benchmark repo](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/TFB_Prediction_Benchmark)

# Data Availability

* The [MultiAssayExperiment](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html) object based on which
all models were trained and predictions were generated

* Pretrained models

* Precomputed insertion/footprint profiles
